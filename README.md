# bowling-game

A Clojure library designed to solve the `Bowling Kata` proposed by
Uncle Bob some time ago.

I am going to use TDD to solve it.


## Rules

    - The bowling game is split in 10 frames
    - Each frame contains 2 rolls (or "throws")
    - Your score is the sum of the pins you knocked out with each of
    the rolls
      - Special case 1: 10 pints w/ 2 balls; you can roll again 
      (sum 5 +  5 + next-roll)
      - Special case 2: 10 pints w/ 1 ball; you can roll again twice.
      (sum 10 + next-roll-1 + next-roll-2)
